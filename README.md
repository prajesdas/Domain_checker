# Domain Checker

Generates potentially pronounceable domain names and automatically checks whether they're available for purchase.


## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it [here]().

2. Install `uv`. Ask ChatGPT if you don't know how.

3. To generate a list from scratch, run `uv run python generate.py`.

4. To re-use an existing list and keep checking, rename it to `domains.csv`, then run `uv run python check.py`.

5. To stop checking at any point, press CTRL-C exactly **once** and wait while your progress is saved.
